### Task 1
Slide 7![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73683982/131194869-1f6cdb95-8125-4348-be47-27da3277b3a9.png)

* Groomers’ customers leave at a rapid rate within their first year of joining the company. Business Implications and Suggestions:

  + Customers lose interest in Groomers’ products quickly within the first year of initial purchase. This could be due to the product itself. The issues that may be prevalent are bad product quality, popular competitor products, or marketing and presentation of products. Groomers should consider conducting market analysis to identify which areas they may be lacking in regarding product presentation and popularity.
 
  + Customers may not be getting the experience they are looking for when going to purchase or using Groomers’ products. The more recent cohorts have a lower customer retention rate at Groomers than older cohorts which may indicate quality of customer service experience declining in the first year. Groomers should consider collecting survey data on customer experience both for in store experience and using the product itself.

* Groomer’s most loyal cohort is those customers that joined in 2016. Business Implications and Suggestions:

  + The 2016 cohort is the most loyal to Groomers, their customer retention rates are above average, meaning that more customers out of this cohort are staying with the company for a longer period of time. Groomers should consider focusing efforts on the 2016 cohort to ensure that they continue to stay loyal to their company. Groomers should consider creating a loyalty program to continue to incentive loyal customers to repeat purchases.

* Overall, there is a steep decline in revenue retention from the initial period of joining Groomers, to the end of recorded time for each cohort. After each consecutive year, customers are not spending as much as they did at their initial purchase time.

  + Groomers is losing ~ 84.2% - 89% of revenue from initial purchase to end of time period for each of the cohorts. In order to increase revenue retention, Groomers should implement subscription program which would allow more consistent stream of revenue per customer.

* Each cohort follows a decreasing revenue retention trend as mentioned above, however, the more recent the cohort, the faster decline in revenue retention they have. 

  + The 2016 cohort has the highest revenue retention. Groomers should focus their efforts on analyzing the 2016 cohort. Some possible methods are running cluster analysis to find similarities on 2016 cohort.

  + Groomers should consider running a cluster analysis to find out which customers are more similar to each other. This can be used to find and compare which cohorts are more similar.

  + Additionally, Groomers should consider using the KNN approach to find cohort customers similar to the 2016 cohort to predict purchasing patterns and create targeted marketing campaigns to retain similar customers.

### Task 2
Automate the insights derived from Task 1. The objective of this task is to allow reproducibility creating an R code that can be applied to various datasets.
